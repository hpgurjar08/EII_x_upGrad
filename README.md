**Instantly Transform Educational Content into Dynamic Learning Assets.**

Forge AI is an intelligent content repurposing engine designed for the modern educator. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini API, it takes any piece of educational contentâ€”from pasted text to PDF/DOCX documentsâ€”and instantly forges it into a suite of ready-to-use learning materials.

## 1. Problem Statement

In today's diverse learning landscape, educators, instructional designers, and content creators spend countless hours manually adapting lesson plans for different needs. A single piece of content often needs to be:

* **Summarized** for quick reviews.
* Turned into a **quiz** for knowledge assessment.
* Broken down into **flashcards** for studying.
* **Translated** for a global audience.

This repetitive, time-consuming work is a major pain point that stifles creativity and slows down the pace of educational development.
